Dear _____ (name):

	Your work has been excellent.  However, your
absentee record is now overshadowing your work record.
I realize that your health has been poor but one of
our job requirements is regular attendance.  We have
difficulty scheduling when we cannot depend on your
attendance.      

	We have discussed this subject with you 
several times before.  Now your attendance must
meet our requirements or we will have to
terminate you.

					Sincerely,
