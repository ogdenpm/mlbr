Dear ____ (name):

     	This letter is to inform you that recently there have
been many mistakes in our billing.  Can this situation be 
rectified?

	I am sure that you would agree that if a little more
time, care and effort was made towards accuracy on the part
of your accounting department, we would mutually benefit.

					Sincerely,
