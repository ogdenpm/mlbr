Dear ____ (name):	

	Thank you so much for your recent letter requesting a
donation to ___ (charity).  However, it is impossible to support  
all the worthwhile causes in each area that our company has offices
in.  Therefore, our company makes an annual contribution to the
United Way Fund which then supports many local organizations.

	Because of the above policy, we are unable to make a
contribution to the local ____ (charity).  It is a fine project
and we wish you luck in your endeavors.

					Sincerely,
