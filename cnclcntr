Dear Sir or Madam:

	This certified letter is to cancel the order I placed
____ (any time within three days) with one of your door-to-door
encyclopedia salesmen.  He was extremely pushy and I acted 
impulsively.  After he left, I regretted my action.

	Luckily, a friend pointed out the law stating that 
there is a three-day "cooling off" period in this state in
which buyers may cancel orders placed with door-to-door salesmen.
I checked this information out with the Attorney General.

	Enclosed you will find a copy of my contract.  I have
also told my bank to stop payment on the down payment check.

	The above mentioned actions should conclude this matter.     
I regret any inconvenience that I may have caused your company.

  				 Sincerely,
							


				(name)
	
			
Enclosure
