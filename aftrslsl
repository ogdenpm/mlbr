Dear ____ (name):

	I am taking the liberty of writing you this letter
instead of interrupting you by phone.

	Last week I mailed you a brief proposal.  Now I am
wondering if it suits your company's needs.

	We wish to do business with you and would appreciate
it if you would let us know as soon as possible if we fit
into your plans.

	                             Cordially yours,



	                             (name)
