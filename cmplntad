Dear Sir or Madam:

	We have been receiving many complaints from our customers
about your ____ (item).  They have not been satisfactory and,
therefore, we have had to refund the purchase price on many of them.

	The trouble seems to be with the last shipment.  The ______
(item) before seemed sufficient and we did not have any complaints
from our customers.

	Please check to see if there was an error in making these
___ (item).  We would also like to suggest that you check to see
if they are being packed with enough protection for shipping.

	We have ___ (amount left) left and we would like to have
you send us a replacement shipment.  We will wait for instructions
from you before returning this, these (item).

                                         Sincerely,
