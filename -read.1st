If you're NEW to the LZH encoding algorithm, you must first extract all 
of the files in this library via NULU or some other such library 
utility.  The file UCRZLH11.COM is uncompressed and will decode all of 
the files that are compressed.  Merely use the command:

    UCRLZH11 *.?Y?

Z80s only.  However, I'm making an update to LT to handle LZH decoding 
and a program based on FCRUNCH for LZH encoding.  Look for those if you 
require 8080-only opcodes.

MOST of the code and docs are based on CRUNCH and UNCRunch.  Any typos 
you find are yours to keep (that is, in modifying/reading/updating the 
large volume of existing docs for LZH, I undoubtedly have left behind 
some amusing and/or frustrating half-sentences and such...sorry).
