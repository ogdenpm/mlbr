Dear Sir or Madam:

       	We have a very uncomfortable request - we are asking for
an extension of time on our bill for ____ (amount).

	We had been depending on a check from one of our clients
to cover this bill.  However, we have just been informed that this
check will not arrive until _______ (date).

	Therefore, we must ask for your indulgence and grant us
a two weeks' extension of time on our bill.  We are sorry about
any inconvenience this may bring to you.

                                         Respectfully,
