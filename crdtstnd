Dear ____ (name):

	As requested, we are replying to your recent letter of
querie regarding ________ (name) as a credit risk.

	In all fairness to you, we regret that we cannot
recommend this firm.  Despite the fact that we granted 
generous credit privileges for ____ (time period), they
did not meet their agreed upon obligations and were lax
in their payment.  Therefore, we withdrew these privileges
and now will only do business on a cash basis.

	This is the only basis that we feel secure in dealing
with _______ (name of company).

				Yours truly,
