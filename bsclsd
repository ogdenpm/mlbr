Dear ____ (name):

	I am sure you are aware of the poor economic 
conditions.  Because of this fact, we have had to eliminate
certain positions.  Sadly, your position is one of those
to be eliminated.  

	We hope that as economic conditions improve we
will be able to consider you for another position.  We
wish you every success in finding a new position and
we extend our thanks for the good work you have done
for us.

					Respectfully,
